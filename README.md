# Actually I am doing project on cycle life prediction of battery using ML ,
# for part A I am attaching colab link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yHf3x3og0JAVBL7Hmmw0ppwaxa8gU246?authuser=2
#for part B : Actual data set is : https://data.matr.io/1   after I have extracted some useful ones : data set used in above is in:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fjMp2JqRxQe0j9cD_iKi023CZ3E4VsYY/view?usp=sharing
# for part C: I ahev used linear regression because there is supposed to be  linear relation between cycle life vs VarQ100- VarQ10.
